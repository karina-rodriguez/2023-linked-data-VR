To enable collaboration and open access as well as [open science practices](https://reproducibilitea.org/), 
it is recommended to manage the multidimensional media in a way
which is accessible to the team you are working with and with 
others who might benefit from the 
effort you have done to curate the data. 

There are some web-platforms which can easily allow this, such as
document management and storage system, e.g. 

- [Microsoft Sharepoint](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com), 
- [Google Drive](https://www.google.com), and 
- [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/). 

All of this allow
for sharing capabilities with people within and beyond your organisations.

Other systems such as Virtual Research Environments are also available for
sharing data with the same community of practice. 


## Virtual Research Environments (VRE)

VREs make it easy for teams across
organisations to collaborate in data-driven research process.
We will use [D4Science](https://services.d4science.org/) in this lesson.

For example, a project that you are developing with friends/colleagues
might involve investigating how it was living in Brighton 
in the 18th century. You might be using this to recreate
visually a scene in the city.

Visual information can make it easier to develop
the project, and it can also be more engaging
for users to feedback on
early prototypes. 

Information can include:

- Mapping the geographical areas which were inhabited in Brighton
as well as any roads.
- What architecture did larger and smaller buildings had?
- How did people dress?
- What activities they did?

To enable collaboration and support FAIR principles,
Virtual Research Environments (VRE) can be useful.
VREs are collaborative environments created 
on-demand allowing remote sharing of applications, 
services and data resources.

We will make use of [D4Science](https://services.d4science.org/group/culturedigitalskills)
to explore further these environments.

Login by 
using your existing login credentials, e.g. 
the one of your institution or your google account.

## Geting authorisation: Login to the VRE


Link: [https://services.d4science.org/group/d4science-services-gateway/explore](https://services.d4science.org/group/d4science-services-gateway/explore)


If you have never logged in before, you will need to follow a few steps:

1. Accept the Terms and Conditions.

2. Select to join the 'CultureDigitalSkills' project. 

3. Click on request to join CultureDigitalSkills VRE and  
 wait for approval from the administrator.
 
4. Once you have received an email of approval, logout and in again 
if you have any issues accessing the VRE.

:::::::::: solution

You will see the main interface upon successful login.
See below.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

The VRE offers the following capabilities:

- **Workspace**: enables members to store and share data securely.
- **Mailing System and Forum**: enable members to community
one-to-one or as a community.
- **Data Analytics**: enable members to access
cloud computing facilities to colaborate
in developing and applying data-algorithms.

To test some of these access in the main interface, the
menu bar at the top showing the **Workspace** and an **Analytics**
menu items. Click on any of them to access this
functionality.

Click on **Workspace**.

## Workspace 
The workspace allows a member to create and share folder, 
as well as upload files.

It facilitates on-line file sharing across organisations.

Folders and data can be shared with all or specific users of the VRE.

:::::::::: challenge

## Testing the Workspace: Upload a file

Using what you have learned on downloading media,
access an example of an image from a repository from 
your institution or a project.

If you don't have any, use the following from Wikimedia:

![[The Garden of Earthly Delights (c. 1490–1510). Triptych, oil on oak panels, 205.5 cm × 384.9 cm (81 in × 152 in). Museo del Prado, Madrid &copy; In the Public Domain](https://commons.m.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Garden_of_earthly_delights.jpg)](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/96/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights.jpg/1024px-The_Garden_of_earthly_delights.jpg){alt="The Garden of earthly delights"}


Create a folder in your workspace, upload the image and share with another
person in the group.

::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


The functionalities that the workspace provides include:

- Preview the file
- Get basic information - note that vary basic metadata, such as name,
ID, and type are supported. There is a description field which allows
for recording additional metadata.
- Version number, as the owner of a file can replace the file keeping
the older versions to facilitate version control.
- Shearable link to the file
- History of operations performed by users to the file.
- Move to another folder.
- Make a copy to another folder.
- Rename and Delete the files.
- Show and Download to the local computer.

:::::::::: challenge

## Challenge: Share a link with another member

Using the VRE send a message to another member
of the group sharing the link to the file you previously uploaded.


::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::


## VRE Analytics
VREs also provide access to 
an interactive development environment for *Notebooks*, code, and data.
For this, the VRE provides access to a [**JupyterLab** enviornment](https://jupyter.org/). It supports over 40 programming languages, 
including Python, Java, R, Julia, and Scala.

The *Notebooks* environment are increasingly used
by researchers where they can combine text, 
mathematics, computations and rich media output. It requires
of a special language for formatting text known as [markup](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/Notebook/Working%20With%20Markdown%20Cells.html).

The environment also support basic editing of text-data 
and the implementation of 
data processing algorithms using high-performance backend computers.

:::::::::: challenge

Access *JupyterLab* in the *Analytics* menu. Select one of the options for
accessing a virtual server.

This will create a 'virtual' machine.

You should find a Navigate to the folder where you created by clicking
on the folder icon on the left menu.

![Workspace folders menu](fig/D4Science_notebook.png){alt="folder"}

Create a new Text file, by clicking on the **+** icon, and selecting
Other -> Text File.

Change its name and save it.

:::::::::: keypoints


- Multidimensional media requires good management, to underpin collaboration and open access/science processes. 

- Virtual Research Environments (VREs) are collaborative spaces 
for data-driven research. 

- VREs offer workspaces for secure data storage, mailing systems, forums, and data analytics capabilities.
