## Data Sets
Data will be produced during the workshop,
so you will mostly need access to a web browswer and some space in your
computer to store the data.
<!--
FIXME: place any data you want learners to use in `episodes/data` and then use
       a relative link ( [data zip file](data/lesson-data.zip) ) to provide a
       link to it, replacing the example.com link.
